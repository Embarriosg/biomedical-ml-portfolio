    "# **Boolean masking and aggregation**\n",
    "\n",
    "In data analysis, it is very common to work with only a subset of an array: values that satisfy a certain condition, fall within a specific range, or need to be summarized in some way. This is where Boolean masking becomes useful. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Boolean masking involves creating arrays of True and False values based on logical conditions, which are then used to select, modify, or analyze specific elements of an array. This approach allows data to be filtered in a clear and efficient way, without relying on explicit loops. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Once the data has been filtered, aggregation makes it possible to summarize the resulting information through operations such as counting, summing, averaging, or finding minimum and maximum values. Together, these techniques form a fundamental toolkit for exploring, cleaning, and understanding data in a vectorized manner using NumPy.\n"
